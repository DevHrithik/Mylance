# Manual Posting & AI Learning Workflow

## 🔄 Core Workflow Overview

### 1. Content Generation & Usage

```
User → Generate Content → Save to Dashboard → Copy to LinkedIn → Mark as "Used" → Post Manually → Add Performance Data → AI Learns
```

### 2. Authentication Flow (Magic Link Only)

- User enters email on signup/login page
- System sends magic link to email
- User clicks link → auto-logged in
- No passwords, no LinkedIn OAuth
- Simple, secure, friction-free

## 📝 Detailed User Journey

### Phase 1: Content Creation

1. **Generate Content**: User inputs topic/idea, AI generates LinkedIn post
2. **Edit & Refine**: User can edit the generated content
3. **Save to Dashboard**: Content saved as "draft" status
4. **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copy for easy pasting to LinkedIn

### Phase 2: Manual Posting

1. **LinkedIn Manual Post**: User goes to LinkedIn, pastes content, posts
2. **Mark as Used**: User returns to Mylance, marks post as "used"
3. **Add LinkedIn URL**: User can optionally add the LinkedIn post URL
4. **Set Posted Date**: User sets when they actually posted it

### Phase 3: Performance Tracking (24-48 hours later)

1. **Performance Entry Form**: Simple form to add metrics
   - Impressions (required)
   - Likes (optional, defaults to 0)
   - Comments (optional, defaults to 0)
   - Shares (optional, defaults to 0)
   - Clicks (optional, defaults to 0)
2. **Auto-Calculate Engagement Rate**: System calculates (likes + comments + shares) / impressions \* 100
3. **Performance Notes**: User can add notes about why they think it performed well/poorly

### Phase 4: AI Learning & Optimization

1. **Data Analysis**: System analyzes content characteristics vs performance
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify what works for this specific user
3. **OpenAI Integration**: Send analysis to OpenAI for insights
4. **Future Optimization**: Use learnings to improve next content generation

## 🎯 Key Features Implementation

### 1. Dashboard Post Management

```typescript
interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
