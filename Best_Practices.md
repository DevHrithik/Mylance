# Mylance Best Practices for Thought Leadership Content on LinkedIn

## **A reminder: why we do thought leadership**

Thought leadership on LinkedIn is designed to build **trust, visibility, and authority** by helping consultants and fractional executives consistently share valuable, experience-driven content on LinkedIn. Your content should:

1. **Grows Awareness**: Increase visibility among decision-makers by sharing tangible outcomes, industry insights, and lessons learned.
2. **Builds Trust**: Demonstrate expertise by telling authentic, experiences, learnings, first-person stories, etc. that show you’ve "been there, done that."

By consistently executing this strategy, your LinkedIn presence becomes a magnet for inbound leads, client conversations, and professional opportunities.

## **Key Principles for Thought Leadership Success**

### **1. Speak to a Specific Audience**

Effective thought leadership content starts with **knowing exactly who you’re speaking to**. This is about tailoring your message to resonate with your **ideal client or decision-maker audience**.

- **We Identify Your Target Audience:** Who you want to reach.
- **Tailored Messages:** Every post speaks directly to their challenges, goals, and pain points. No vague, generalized content that tries to appeal to everyone.

**Example:**

If your ideal audience is early-stage SaaS founders, write posts like, “One common mistake I’ve seen founders make when scaling operations is X. Here’s what works instead.”

### **2. First-Person Storytelling: Be the Guide, Not the Hero**

Thought leadership is most effective when it’s rooted in **authentic, first-person stories**. You’re not bragging—you’re sharing valuable lessons that help your audience.

**Key Elements of Storytelling:**

- **Tell Specific Stories with Tangible Outcomes:**
    - Include details about the company (when possible), the project, and the measurable result. If you can’t name the company, focus on the impact.
    - Example: “When I was leading operations for a mid-stage SaaS company, we reduced churn by 20% in 6 months by implementing X.”
- **Include Mistakes and Vulnerability:**
    - People trust those who are honest about challenges, not just successes.
    - Example: “I almost lost a major client because I made this mistake early on. Here’s what I learned.”
- **Find the Right Balance Between Personal and General Advice:**
    - Avoid generic industry advice. Instead, share your unique perspective and how it differs (if relevant).
    - Example: “Most people will tell you to do X. But in my experience, I’ve found that Y actually works better because…”

### **3. Social Proof: Build Credibility**

To establish authority, your audience needs to see that your advice is credible. We do this by weaving **social proof** into your stories.

- **Use Recognizable Company Names (if possible):**
    - Example: “During my time at Uber, we tackled X challenge by doing Y.”
- **If Company Names Aren’t Possible, Focus on Outcomes:**
    - Highlight the tangible impact you’ve had: “One client increased revenue by 30% after implementing this strategy.”
- **Leverage Audience Engagement as Social Proof:**
    - Share comments, feedback, or questions from your audience that validate your expertise.
    - Example: “I recently posted about [topic], and it sparked a lot of questions in my DMs. Here’s a deeper dive…”

### **4. Formatting & Readability Best Practices**

We ensure that all content is engaging and easy to read by following these formatting rules:

✅ **Short, punchy sentences** – No dense paragraphs.

✅ **Proper spacing** – Each sentence or two should have a line break.

✅ **Bullet points & numbered lists** – Helps readability and engagement.

✅ **Strong hooks** – Every post starts with an engaging first sentence that gives the reader a reason to keep reading and lets them know what they are going to be reading.

✅ **Clear takeaways** – End with insights that add value.

✅ **Minimal self-promotion** – 8-9 out of 10 posts should provide pure value.

❌ **What to Avoid**

- “You” posts that feel preachy.
- Fluffy, generic insights with no depth.
- Dense paragraphs without spacing.
- Excessive use of emojis (should be extremely minimal, if any).

### **5. Content Themes & Pillars**

2. **Common Mistakes:** Share mistakes you’ve seen companies make and how to avoid them.
3. **Your Consulting Journey:** Share personal insights, challenges, and wins from running your own consulting business.

### **7. Network Growth and Engagement Strategy**

To amplify the impact of your thought leadership, it’s essential to not only produce stellar content but also grow and actively engage with your network. This strategy ensures that your posts reach the right decision-makers and that engagement is nurtured effectively.

### **Network Growth**

- **Targeted Connections:**
    - Every week, identify and add **80-100 relevant decision-makers** from your ideal customer profile (ICP).
    - Use LinkedIn’s advanced search features to pinpoint roles and industries that align with your ICP.
- **Connection Requests:**
    - Customize your connection requests to highlight shared interests or mutual connections, and reference your value proposition.
    - Keep track of your weekly connection limits to ensure you stay within LinkedIn’s guidelines.

### **Engagement & Follow-Up**

- **Monitor Post Interactions:**
    - Regularly check who is liking, commenting, and sharing your posts.
    - Engage with these users by replying to their comments and thanking them for their engagement.
- **Direct Messaging:**
    - Follow up with individuals who actively engage with your content. Send them a personalized message that:
        - Thanks them for their interaction.
        - Briefly explains how your content aligns with solving common challenges in their industry.
        - Invites them to schedule a call to explore further insights or potential collaborations.
- **Ongoing Relationship Building:**
    - Maintain a record of engagement to track potential leads.
    - Use insights from these interactions to tailor future content topics and further refine your connection strategy.
    

Integrating this network growth and engagement strategy with your thought leadership content plan, you’re not just broadcasting your message but actively creating conversations, building relationships, and driving meaningful business outcomes.
